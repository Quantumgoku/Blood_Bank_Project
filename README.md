# Decentralized Blood Bank Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Decentralized Blood Bank Management System** that leverages blockchain technology to securely and transparently track blood donations. The system ensures that all donation records are immutable, auditable, and transparent, providing a robust solution for managing blood donations in a secure manner.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Built on Ethereum, this system uses smart contracts to securely store and manage blood donation records on a decentralized ledger.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A React.js frontend provides an intuitive and seamless user experience, allowing donors and recipients to interact with the platform easily.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Integration with Web3.js ensures that all transactions and updates are processed and reflected in real-time.
- **Secure Data Management:** Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB form the backend, ensuring secure handling of user data, donation requests, and transaction records.
- **Transparent Process:** The decentralized nature of the system guarantees transparency and prevents unauthorized alterations to donation records.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Smart Contracts, Web3.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Testing:** Ganache for local Ethereum blockchain testing
